# front-end

Fully functional user operations CRUD application developed on Node.js, React.js and PostgreSQL and docked with docker compose. React.js is built with react-creat-app and the static files are served on Node.js while communicating with a database service that uses the Postgress image.

This repository was used during development and once it was done the build files were generated and added to the Node.js server for deployment.
